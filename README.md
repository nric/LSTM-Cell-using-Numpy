# LSTM-Cell-using-Numpy
An implementation of an LSTM cell puerly written using Numpy (and scipy).

Implemented in accorance to the LSTM reference card from:
https://towardsdatascience.com/the-lstm-reference-card-6163ca98ae87

I did this only for myself to undestand how an LSTM cell work. The output was checked to 
be identical to the one of an Pytorch LSTM cell. 

It is written for cell-wise execution in VS-code using IPykernel (python interactive) fucntionality.
